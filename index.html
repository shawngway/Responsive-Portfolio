                    two years after

                    His hard work and unquenched work ethic comes from the push to have a great life for his wife Kayela
                    and
                    daughter Lyla. Shawn always has a constant push to better himself through self study or acquiring
                    more
                    responsibilties.

                    Continuing to speak in the thrid person I have now broke some walls, there are alot of interests he
                    has. Spending time with his daughter, wife, and friends and family are the thick of his past time.
                    Also, spending time playing various pc and sometimes consol games to quench his competetive spirit.
